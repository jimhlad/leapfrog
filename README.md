# LeapFrog for Laravel

Hate writing CRUD code from scratch? Don't want to memorize any more crazy commands?

LeapFrog is a UI-based CRUD boilerplate generator for Laravel. It allows you to quickly create files according to the Controller-Service-Model pattern.

For example, if you are creating a new "Truck" entity, it will generate or edit the following files for you:

* routes/__web.php__
* app/Models/__Truck.php__
* app/Http/Controllers/__TruckController.php__
* app/Services/__TruckService.php__
* app/Http/Requests/__TruckCreateRequest.php__
* app/Http/Requests/__TruckUpdateRequest.php__
* database/migrations/__xxxx_xx_xx_xxxxxx_create_xxxxxx_table.php__
* resources/views/__truck/index.blade.php__
* resources/views/__truck/create.blade.php__
* resources/views/__truck/edit.blade.php__
* config/forms/__truck.php__

# LeapFrog for Laravel

Hate writing CRUD code from scratch? Don't want to memorize any more crazy commands?

LeapFrog is a UI-based CRUD boilerplate generator for Laravel. It allows you to quickly create files according to the Controller-Service-Model pattern.

For example, if you are creating a new "Truck" entity, it will generate or edit the following files for you:

* routes/__web.php__
* app/Models/__Truck.php__
* app/Http/Controllers/__TruckController.php__
* app/Services/__TruckService.php__
* app/Http/Requests/__TruckCreateRequest.php__
* app/Http/Requests/__TruckUpdateRequest.php__
* database/migrations/__xxxx_xx_xx_xxxxxx_create_xxxxxx_table.php__
* resources/views/__truck/index.blade.php__
* resources/views/__truck/create.blade.php__
* resources/views/__truck/edit.blade.php__
* config/forms/__truck.php__

The interface allows you to pick which files you want to create and even customize the paths to some extent.

## Prerequisites

This package depends on two other separately managed packages being installed:

* [Laravel 5 Extended Generators](https://github.com/laracasts/Laravel-5-Generators-Extended) - An awesome package by Jeffrey Way
* [FormMaker](https://github.com/YABhq/Formmaker) - Another awesome package by Yab Inc.

Please see the above GitHub pages for instructions on installing these packages.

Note: You may need the __dev-master__ version of Laravel 5 Extended Generators if you receive an error installing this package.

## Usage

### Step 1: Install with composer

Install the package using composer:

`composer require jimhlad/leapfrog --dev`

Add the following to the __config/app.php__ in the providers array:

`JimHlad\LeapFrog\LeapFrogServiceProvider::class`

Publish the assets by running:

`php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JimHlad\LeapFrog\LeapFrogServiceProvider"`

### Step 2: Create app layout

The views generated by this package assume the existence of a __views/layouts/app.blade.php__ file. We can generate this by running the standard:

`php artisan make:auth`

### That's it!

You should now be able to point your browser to __your-project-domain/leapfrog__ to see the LeapFrog dashboard.
